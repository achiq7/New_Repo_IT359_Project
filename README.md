## Web Application Vulnerability Scanner (Project Proposal) 
- Project Description:
As a team, we have decided to create a vulnerability scanner that will be applied to a premade web application called OWSAP Juice Shop. Our tool will be used to scan for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, HTTP use, cross site scripting, etc. as well as be atutomated. Our plan is to code using Python which will hold the code for vulnerability scanning as well as a HTML/PDF report of all vulnerabilities found within the application. 

- Plan of Action:
  -  Develop a custom python tool that automates vulnerabilty checks
  -  Document the web security findings from the python tool
  -  Create a human readable HTML/PDF report which would include our findings and different mitigation techniques that we recommend
  
- Tools:
  -  Testing target (OWASP Juice Shop)
  -  Python3
  -  Kali Linux Machine
 
- Deliverables:
  -  Investigation
      -  Parse through common vulnerability paths/files
      -  Navigate through common administrator paths
  - Security checks
       -  Security header checks
       -  SQL checks
       -  Certificate checks
       -  Cross Site Scripting checks
   - Output
       - JSON output
       - Produce HTML/PDF report including:
           - Severity rating
           - Mitigation techniques
